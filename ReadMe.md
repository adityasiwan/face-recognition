# Face Recognition implementation through eigenfaces and SVMs

Python implementation of the eigenfaces technique for representing real facial images using an assortment of base images (computed by performing an eigenanalysis of the face data matrix).


# Software and Libraries

This project uses the following software and Python libraries:

   

  - Python 2.7
  - matplotlib
  - sklit


# Dataset
> The dataset used in this example is a preprocessed excerpt of the “Labeled Faces  in the Wild”, aka LFW:
> The data set contains more than 13,000 images of faces collected from the web. 
> Each face has been labeled with the name of the person pictured. 1680 of the 
> people pictured have two or more distinct photos in the data set. The only 
> constraint on these faces is that they were detected by the Viola-Jones face 
> detector.
